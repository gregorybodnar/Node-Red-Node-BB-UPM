### Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install, usually
this is ~/.node-red .

        npm install node-red-node-upm

### Usage

Only tested on the Intel Edison so far, but it should work on other platforms supported by <a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa" target="_blank">MRAA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm" target="_blank">UPM</a>.

Ensure you have the latest firmware running, and have Node-RED installed.

See the [Intel Downloads](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/home) for
hardware / downloads for your particular board.
